* Now `IBCF()` function shows in `$observed` all the response values from the DataSet.
* Now `IBCF()` function shows in `$Data.Obs_Pred` all the response and predicted values from the DataSet.
* Now `IBCF.Years()` function shows in `$predicted` all the values predicted.
* Now `IBCF.Years()` function shows in `$observed` the response values for all the years from the Traits selected in `Traits.testing`.
* Now `CV.RandomPart()` shows the lenght in every partition in `$CrossValidation_length`.
* Now `CV.RandomPart()` admits `Traits.testing` to only use a `PTesting` percentage defined of the traits specified in the parameter to be used to fit the model.
